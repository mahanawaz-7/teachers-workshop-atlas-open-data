# Explore the Z and Higgs Bosons Through Data from the ATLAS Experiment!
Dive into experimental data with this interactive app! By applying your own selection criteria to filter events, you'll uncover the signatures of the Z and Higgs bosons in the resulting plots. Experience the thrill of discovery just like a particle physicist!

### Objectives
In these analyses, you will:

- Identify the Z boson: By examining the invariant mass of particle pairs, you'll reveal a sharp peak at the Z boson's mass.
- Uncover the Higgs boson decaying to ZZ: You'll produce a plot of the invariant mass of four leptons, getting the signature of the Higgs boson in the Higgs to ZZ channel.

Below are the plots we’re aiming for in this analysis:

As you progress, we’ll explain how these plots are created and what they reveal about these fundamental particles.
