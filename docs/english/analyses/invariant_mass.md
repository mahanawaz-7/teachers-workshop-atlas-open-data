## Unveiling Particles with Invariant Mass"
The *invariant mass* is a important tool in particle physics. It allows us to reconstruct the mass of particles that are produced in collisions, even if we don't observe them directly. By analyzing the energy and momentum of the leptons in the final state, we can calculate their combined *invariant mass*.

When plotted, the invariant mass distribution often shows peaks where particles like the Z boson or Higgs boson appear. These peaks reveal the characteristic mass of the particle, allowing us to \"see\" it even though it's long gone by the time we're analyzing the data.

By calculating and plotting the invariant mass, you will be able to observe these peaks and potentially discover particles for yourself!
