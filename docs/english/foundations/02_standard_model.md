# The Standard Model

The Standard Model is a theory that organizes and describes the fundamental particles that make up everything in the universe and the forces that act between them. Think of it as the “[periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table)” for particle physics. It divides particles into two main categories: fermions and bosons.

## Fermions: The Matter Particles

Fermions are the particles that make up matter itself, and for each of them, there exists an antiparticle with opposite charge and certain properties reversed. They are divided into two groups: quarks and leptons.

- **Quarks**: These are particles that form protons and neutrons, which are found in the nucleus of an atom. There are six types of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks never exist alone in nature; they combine in groups to form larger particles like protons (made of two up quarks and one down quark) and neutrons (two down quarks and one up quark).
- **Leptons**: Unlike quarks, leptons can exist alone. The most familiar lepton is the electron, which orbits the nucleus of an atom. There are six leptons in total: the electron, muon, and tau (all negatively charged), each with a corresponding neutrino (electron neutrino, muon neutrino, tau neutrino), which are neutral. Neutrinos are incredibly light and interact very weakly with other particles, making them challenging to detect.

Fermions follow the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle), meaning no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle is why matter has structure; for instance, electrons in an atom occupy different energy levels rather than all crowding into the same space.

## Bosons: The Force Carriers

While fermions make up matter, bosons are the particles that mediate forces between them. Each fundamental force has an associated boson that “carries” that force:

- **Photon**: Carries the electromagnetic force, which affects charged particles like electrons and protons. This force keeps electrons bound to the nucleus in atoms.
- **W and Z Bosons**: These particles mediate the weak nuclear force, responsible for [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay). The weak force plays a crucial role in nuclear reactions in stars.
- **Gluon**: The carrier of the strong nuclear force, which holds quarks together inside protons and neutrons, and in turn, holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.
- **Higgs Boson**: The Higgs boson is unique. Discovered in 2012, it is associated with the Higgs field, which gives mass to particles like quarks and leptons as they interact with it. Without the Higgs boson, particles would not have the mass needed to form atoms and, ultimately, the universe as we know it.

Bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which is why they can overlap in the same state. For instance, photons in a laser beam can be in the same quantum state, allowing them to create a [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)) light beam.
