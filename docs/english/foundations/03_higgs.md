# The Higgs Boson
The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle that plays a crucial role in giving mass to other particles. Discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), its existence confirmed a vital part of the Standard Model. But what exactly makes it so important?

## The Higgs Field and Mass
To understand the Higgs boson, we first need to introduce the Higgs field. Imagine the Higgs field as an invisible energy field that fills the entire universe, similar to how water fills an ocean. Particles interact with this field as they move through it, and this interaction slows them down, giving them mass. The stronger a particle’s interaction with the Higgs field, the more mass it gains. Some particles, like photons, don’t interact with the Higgs field at all, which is why they remain massless and can travel at the speed of light.

The Higgs boson is the particle associated to this field, a manifestation that confirms the field’s existence. It’s similar to a ripple in the water – just as a ripple indicates the presence of water, the Higgs boson reveals the Higgs field.

## How the Higgs Boson is Produced
At the LHC, Higgs bosons are produced in various ways, known as **production modes**. These modes depend on the particles involved in the initial interaction and are best understood through [Feynman diagrams](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2759490/files/Feynman%20Diagrams%20-%20ATLAS%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf), which provide a visual representation of particle interactions:

- **Gluon Fusion**: The most common production mode at the LHC, where two gluons (from protons in the collider) interact to produce a Higgs boson via a loop of heavy quarks, often the top quark (image 1). This process is highly probable because of the strong interaction between gluons and quarks.

- **Vector Boson Fusion (VBF)**: In this mode, two quarks each emit a W or Z boson, which interact to produce a Higgs boson (image 2). The quarks themselves are often scattered at high angles, leaving a distinctive signature of two “jets” in the detector.

- **Associated Production (or Higgs-Strahlung)**: Here, a Higgs boson is produced along with either a W or Z boson (image 3).

- **Top-Quark Fusion**: A rarer mode where a Higgs boson is produced in association with a top quark pair (image 4). This process helps study the interaction between the Higgs and the heaviest known particle, the top quark.

## How the Higgs Boson Decays
Once produced, the Higgs boson decays almost immediately. The specific way it decays—called the decay channel—depends on its mass and interaction probabilities with other particles:

- **Higgs to two photons (H→γγ)**: The Higgs boson decays into two photons, which are easier to detect because they produce a clear signal in the detector. This channel helped confirm the Higgs discovery because it has a distinct signature and relatively low background noise.

- **Higgs to two Z bosons (H→ZZ)**: The Higgs boson decays into a pair of Z bosons, each of which can decay further into pairs of leptons, such as electrons or muons. This decay chain allows the reconstruction of the Higgs boson’s presence by observing the four-lepton final state. This is what we are doing in the workshop!

- **Higgs to two W bosons (H→WW)**: In this decay mode, the Higgs boson decays into a pair of W bosons, which further decay into leptons and neutrinos.

## Why the Higgs Boson Matters
The Higgs boson is important for a few reasons:
- **Completing the Standard Model**: The Higgs boson was the last missing particle of the Standard Model, providing the final confirmation that our theoretical framework is correct.
- **Explaining Mass**: Without the Higgs field, particles like quarks and electrons would be massless, and atoms as we know them couldn’t form. This field explains why matter has substance and why our universe has structure.
- **Opening Doors Beyond the Standard Model**: While it completes the Standard Model, the Higgs boson also raises questions about physics beyond this theory, such as the nature of dark matter, which doesn’t seem to interact with the Higgs field, and the origin of dark energy.

## Detecting the Higgs Boson
Detecting the Higgs boson is no easy feat. It has a very short lifetime, decaying into other particles almost immediately after it’s produced. At ATLAS we were able to identify it by looking for these decay products, particularly in **Higgs to two Z bosons** and **Higgs to two photons decays**. Observing these specific decay patterns allowed us to recognize the “fingerprint” of the Higgs boson.
